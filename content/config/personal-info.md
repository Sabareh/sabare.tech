# Personal Information

## Professional Summary

I build bank-grade data pipelines at Stanbic Bank Kenya, replacing brittle Oracle/EDW routines with Python + Airflow DAGs that are observable, validation-first, and easy to operate. My work centers on data loading patterns that reuse query → read_sql → to_sql flows, delivering trustworthy GL integrity, interest change, and ingestion pipelines for Finance, Risk, and Operations teams. I pair that with stakeholder-friendly runbooks, metrics, and Power BI dashboards so every team knows the health of their data products.
