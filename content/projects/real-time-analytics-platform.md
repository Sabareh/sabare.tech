# Real-Time Analytics Platform

## Project Overview

Built a comprehensive real-time analytics platform that processes over 10 million events per day, providing sub-second query performance for business-critical analytics. The platform serves as the backbone for real-time decision making across multiple business units.

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built on a modern, cloud-native architecture:

### Data Ingestion Layer
- **Apache Kafka**: Event streaming platform handling 10M+ events/day
- **Schema Registry**: Centralized schema management for data evolution
- **Kafka Connect**: Automated data ingestion from various sources

### Stream Processing Layer
- **Spark Streaming**: Real-time data processing with exactly-once semantics
- **Custom Processors**: Business logic implementation for data transformation
- **State Management**: Distributed state handling for complex aggregations

### Storage Layer
- **ClickHouse**: Columnar database optimized for analytical queries
- **Data Partitioning**: Time-based partitioning for optimal query performance
- **Compression**: Advanced compression reducing storage costs by 60%

### Serving Layer
- **REST APIs**: High-performance APIs for data access
- **GraphQL**: Flexible query interface for frontend applications
- **Caching**: Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data

## Key Challenges Solved

### 1. High-Throughput Processing
**Challenge**: Processing 10M+ events per day with sub-second latency requirements.

**Solution**: Implemented a multi-tier processing architecture with Kafka for ingestion and Spark Streaming for processing. Used optimal partitioning strategies and parallel processing to achieve required throughput.

### 2. Exactly-Once Processing
**Challenge**: Ensuring no data loss or duplication in a distributed system.

**Solution**: Implemented Spark Streaming with checkpointing and idempotent operations. Used Kafka's exactly-once semantics and transactional producers.

### 3. Horizontal Scaling
**Challenge**: Handling traffic spikes and growing data volumes.

**Solution**: Deployed on Kubernetes with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA). Implemented auto-scaling based on queue depth and CPU utilization.

### 4. High Availability
**Challenge**: Maintaining 99.9% uptime SLA for business-critical operations.

**Solution**: Implemented multi-zone deployment, circuit breakers, and comprehensive monitoring. Created automated failover mechanisms and disaster recovery procedures.

## Implementation Details

### Kafka Configuration
\`\`\`yaml
# Kafka cluster configuration
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: analytics-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    version: 3.4.0
    replicas: 6
    config:
      num.partitions: 12
      default.replication.factor: 3
      min.insync.replicas: 2
\`\`\`

### Spark Streaming Job
\`\`\`python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("RealTimeAnalytics") \
    .config("spark.sql.streaming.checkpointLocation", "/checkpoints") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Read from Kafka
events_df = spark \
    .readStream \
    .format("kafka") \
    .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "kafka:9092") \
    .option("subscribe", "user_events") \
    .load()

# Process events
processed_df = events_df \
    .select(from_json(col("value").cast("string"), schema).alias("data")) \
    .select("data.*") \
    .withWatermark("timestamp", "10 minutes") \
    .groupBy(window(col("timestamp"), "1 minute"), col("user_id")) \
    .agg(count("*").alias("event_count"))

# Write to ClickHouse
query = processed_df \
    .writeStream \
    .format("clickhouse") \
    .option("host", "clickhouse:8123") \
    .option("table", "user_analytics") \
    .outputMode("append") \
    .start()
\`\`\`
