# Real-Time Analytics Platform

## Project Overview

Built a comprehensive real-time analytics platform that processes over 10 million events per day, providing sub-second query performance for business-critical analytics. The platform serves as the backbone for real-time decision making across multiple business units.

## Key Features

- **High Throughput**: Processes 10M+ events per day
- **Low Latency**: Sub-second query response times
- **Fault Tolerant**: 99.95% uptime with automatic failover
- **Scalable**: Auto-scaling based on load patterns
- **Real-time**: Live dashboards and alerting

## Technical Architecture

### Data Ingestion
- Apache Kafka for event streaming
- Schema Registry for data governance
- Kafka Connect for automated ingestion

### Stream Processing
- Spark Streaming for real-time processing
- Custom business logic processors
- Exactly-once processing semantics

### Storage & Serving
- ClickHouse for analytical queries
- Redis for caching
- REST APIs and GraphQL endpoints

## Results

- **Performance**: Reduced query time from 30s to <1s
- **Reliability**: 99.95% uptime over 6 months
- **Scale**: Processed 3.6B+ events without data loss
- **Impact**: Enabled real-time business decision making
