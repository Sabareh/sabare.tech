# Real-Time Analytics Platform

A comprehensive platform for ingesting, processing, and visualizing streaming data in real-time. Built with modern technologies and designed for high throughput and low latency.

## Architecture

The platform consists of several key components:

### Data Ingestion
- Apache Kafka for reliable message queuing
- Custom connectors for various data sources
- Schema validation and evolution

### Stream Processing
- Apache Flink for stateful stream processing
- Complex event processing (CEP)
- Windowed aggregations and analytics

### Storage
- TimescaleDB for time-series data
- Redis for caching and real-time leaderboards
- S3-compatible object storage for raw data

### Visualization
- React-based dashboard
- Real-time charts and graphs
- Customizable alerts and notifications

## Key Features

- Sub-second end-to-end latency
- Horizontal scalability for high throughput
- Fault tolerance and exactly-once processing
- Interactive dashboards with real-time updates
- Anomaly detection and alerting
- Historical data replay

## Technical Challenges

### Handling Late-Arriving Data
We implemented a watermarking strategy in Flink to handle late-arriving data while maintaining accurate aggregations.

### Scaling the Visualization Layer
To support thousands of concurrent dashboard users, we implemented a WebSocket-based architecture with client-side state management.

### Ensuring Data Consistency
We designed a two-phase commit protocol to ensure consistency between the stream processing results and the persistent storage.

## Results

The platform successfully processes millions of events per second with sub-second latency, enabling real-time decision making and business insights.
